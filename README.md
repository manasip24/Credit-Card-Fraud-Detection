# Credit Card Fraud Detection System



## Overview

The Credit Card Fraud Detection System is a machine learning-based system designed to detect and prevent credit card fraud. It utilizes historical transaction data stored in a MySQL database and is developed using Python.

## Project Description

Credit card fraud is a significant concern for both individuals and organizations. This project aims to provide a solution that can identify fraudulent transactions while minimizing false positives, ensuring a secure payment experience.

The key components of the project include:

- Data Collection: Utilizing a suitable dataset of credit card transactions that includes both legitimate and fraudulent transactions. [Credit Card Fraud Detection dataset on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud/) 
- Data Preprocessing: Cleaning and preprocessing the dataset to handle missing values, outliers, and class imbalance.
- Data Storage: Setting up a MySQL database to store the preprocessed transaction data.
- Model Development: Implementing machine learning algorithms for fraud detection, including Logistic Regression and others.
- Model Evaluation: Assessing the model's performance using various metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC.
- Real-time Detection (Optional): Implementing real-time fraud detection for incoming transactions.
- Visualization: Creating visualizations to illustrate the model's performance.
- User Interface (Optional): Developing a simple web-based user interface for transaction input and fraud detection results.
- Deployment: Deploying the fraud detection system to a production environment capable of handling real-time data.
- Continuous Monitoring: Continuously monitoring the model's performance and setting up alerting mechanisms for potential fraud cases.
- Documentation: Providing comprehensive documentation on how to use the system, interpret results, and any limitations.
- Security and Compliance: Ensuring compliance with data protection regulations (e.g., GDPR) and implementing security measures.
- Scaling (Optional): Considering scalability options for handling a large volume of transactions.
- Collaboration and Feedback: Collaborating with fraud detection experts to improve system accuracy and effectiveness.
